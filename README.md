A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Wikipedia, the author of this website found, in an obscure nook of one of the articles, the following word, engraved by hand upon the post: —Data.

## Few Liner Bio
Hi, I’m Abhisek Ganguly (19). I’m a data scientist. Wikipedia defines a data scientist as a someone who uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data. In simple words, I find order and beauty in chaos. I use my programming, statistical and mathematical knowledge to create insights from data. I’m currently a first year engineering student at the VIT Bhopal University, in Madhya Pradesh, India. My major is computer science and I specialize in Computational and Data Science.
